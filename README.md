## Description

The Rest API is an approach to developing web services that uses the principles of the HTTP protocol. When creating a REST API, developers use Rest Controllers to define endpoints that handle different HTTP requests. Furthermore, it is important to document the API to facilitate its understanding and use, with Swagger being a common tool for this task. To ensure proper handling of business exceptions, it is possible to enable handlers that capture and handle specific errors related to the application's business logic.
